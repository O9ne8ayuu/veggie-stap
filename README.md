## 🚀 Technologies Used

### ✅ React (with JSX)
React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces.  
We used **JSX** (JavaScript XML), a syntax extension that allows writing HTML elements in JavaScript and placing them in the DOM without using functions like `createElement()`.

**Why React?**
- Component-based architecture
- Efficient updates via Virtual DOM
- State management for dynamic content

---

### ✅ JavaScript
JavaScript is used for:
- Component logic
- DOM manipulation
- Managing application state and events

---

### ✅ Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a CSS framework that helps build responsive and mobile-first websites quickly.

**Used for:**
- Layout (Grid system)
- Buttons, cards, modals, etc.
- Responsive navbar and forms

---

### ✅ React-Bootstrap *(optional)*
Sometimes used alongside Bootstrap to integrate components in a React-friendly way without jQuery.

---

### ✅ React Toastify
Used for **non-blocking notifications** like:
- Item added to cart
- Order confirmation
- Form submission status

**Benefits:**
- Easy to implement
- Auto-closing toasts
- Custom styling

---

### ✅ Other Frontend Tools & Concepts
